== Building from source [[building]]

The following guide is mainly targeted towards a Linux or Mac OSX development
machine. 

=== Prerequisites [[prerequisites]]

You need to install:

* `go` (>= v1.8)
* `git`
* `mercurial`
* `make`

==== Check your Go version [[check-go-version]]

Run the following command to find out your Go version.

----
$ go version
----

*You must at least have Go version 1.9.*

See <<fetch-dependencies>> to see an explanaition on how we deal with
dependencies.

==== Install dep [[dep-setup]]

This project uses https://github.com/golang/dep[dep] as a package manager for Go.
Running the `make deps` command will install `dep` in `$GOPATH/bin` if it's not already available on your system.

=== Get the code [[get-the-code]]

Assuming you have Go installed and configured (have `$GOPATH` setup) here is
how to build.

Check out the code

----
$ git clone https://github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
----

=== Build [[build]]

Like most other projects, this one depends on various other projects that need
to be downloaded.

We also generate some code from design files that shall make it into our
final artifacts.

To fetch the dependencies, generate code and finally build the project you can
type `make build` in a freshly clone repository of this project.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make build
----


==== Special make targets

There is no need to fetch the dependencies, or re-generate code every time you
want to compile. That's why we offer special `make` targets for these topics:

 * <<deps>>
 * <<generate>>
 * <<build>>
 * <<clean>>
 * <<test-unit>>
 * <<tests>>
 
===== Fetch dependencies [[deps]]

This will download all the dependencies for this project inside a directory
called `vendor`. This way we can ensure that every developer and our CI system
is using the same version.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make deps
----

For dependency management of `go` packages we use https://github.com/golang/dep[`dep`].

The file `Gopkg.toml` contains all dependencies. If you want to understand the format for this file, look link:https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/Gopkg.toml.html[here].

===== Generate GOA sources [[generate]]

You need to run this command if you just checked out the code and later if
you've modified the designs.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make generate
----

===== Build [[build]]

If you want to just build the Auth server and client, run `make build`.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make build
----

===== Clean [[clean]]

This removes all downloaded dependencies, all generated code and compiled
artifacts.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make clean
----

===== Tests [[tests]]

Here's how to run all available tests. All tests will check all Go packages
except those in the `vendor/` directory.
Make sure you have docker and docker-compose available.

Setting up test environment - `make integration-test-env-prepare`

Tear test environment down - `make integration-test-env-tear-down`

[horizontal]
unit-tests::
Unit tests have the minimum requirement on time and environment setup.
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make test-unit
----

integration-tests::
Integration tests demand more setup (i.e. the PostgreSQL DB must be already
running) and probably time. We recommend that you use `docker-compose up -d db`.
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make test-integration
----

all::
To run both, the unit and the integration tests you can run
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/admin-console
$ make test-all
----

By default, test data is removed from the database after each test, unless the `ADMIN_CLEAN_TEST_DATA` environment variable is set to `false`. This can be particularily useful to run queries on the test data after a test failure, in order to understand why the result did not match the expectations.

Also, all SQL queries can be displayed in the output if the `ADMIN_ENABLE_DB_LOGS` environment variable is set to `true. Beware that this can be very verbose, though ;)
